Online Course: A.I
Batch -14
Maze Generation: I choose Recursive algorithm to curve paths in the maze. The code starts by generating mazes of different sizes (5x5, 10x10, and 20x20). These mazes are represented as strings, with '#' representing walls, 'S' representing the start point, and 'E' representing the end point.
1.	A*: 
The astar(maze) function implements the A* algorithm for pathfinding. It calculates the heuristic function for each node and uses a priority queue for efficient exploration.
2.	BFS Algorithm: 
The bfs(maze) function implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for pathfinding. It explores the maze in a breadth-first manner using a queue.
3.	DFS Algorithm:
The dfs(maze) function implements the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for pathfinding. It explores the maze in a depth-first manner using recursion.
4.	Experiment Runner: 
The run_experiment(maze, algorithm) function takes a maze and an algorithm function as input, runs the algorithm, and records execution time, space usage, path length, and completeness.
5.	Visualization:
 The code uses matplotlib to create visualize the results of the experiments. It plots execution time, space usage, and path length for each algorithm and maze size or complexity.

Maze Complexity Experiments:
The code conducts experiments to analyze how maze complexity (defined by a parameter between 0.2 and 0.8) affects the performance of the pathfinding algorithms.
It measures the time taken, space used, path length, and completeness (whether a path was found) for A*, BFS, and DFS on mazes of varying complexity.The experiments reveal how the algorithms perform on mazes with different levels of obstacles (0.2 being less complex, 0.8 being highly complex).
Maze Size Experiments:
The code conducts experiments to analyze how maze size affects algorithm performance.Similar to the complexity experiments, it measures time, space, path length, and completeness for A*, BFS, and DFS on mazes of different sizes (5x5, 10x10, and 20x20).
This helps evaluate the scalability of the algorithms concerning maze size.
Start-End Point Distance Experiments:
The code conducts experiments to analyze how the distance between the start and end points affects algorithm performance.It sets different distances (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30) between 'S' and 'E' in the maze and measures the performance of the algorithms.
Performance Metrics:
For each experiment, the code measures the following performance metrics:
Execution time: The time taken by each algorithm to find a path.
Space used: The memory space used by the algorithm.
Path length: The length of the path found.
Completeness: Whether a path was found (completeness = 1) or not (completeness = 0).
 
 


Trade-offs: 
A* strikes a balance between optimality and efficiency by using heuristics  to guide its search. BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path but may be inefficient in terms of memory usage. DFS is memory-efficient but may not always find the shortest path.
Results:
1.	Maze Size vs. Algorithm Performance:
•	All three algorithms (A*, BFS, DFS) perform well in small mazes (5x5).
•	As maze size increases, A* and BFS generally maintain reasonable performance, while DFS becomes less efficient due to its exploration strategy.
2.	Maze Complexity vs. Algorithm Performance:
•	A* and BFS continue to perform reasonably well as maze complexity increases, but the time taken may increase.
•	DFS performs well in less complex mazes but becomes inefficient in highly complex mazes.
3.	Start-End Point Distance vs. Algorithm Performance:
•	A* and BFS exhibit good performance even when the distance between 'S' and 'E' is large.
•	DFS may struggle to find paths in larger distances due to its deep exploration approach.
4.	Completeness:
•	None of the algorithms consistently guarantee completeness in all scenarios, indicating that they may fail to find a path, especially in highly complex mazes or when the distance between start and end points is extensive.
Conclusions:
1.	A *:
•	A* is often the most suitable algorithm for solving pathfinding problems in mazes.
•	It is capable of finding optimal paths (shortest paths) due to its heuristic-guided search.
•	A* is efficient in terms of time and space, making it a strong choice for various maze-based applications.
2.	BFS Algorithm:
•	BFS is suitable when memory usage is not a concern and finding the shortest path is a priority.
•	It guarantees optimality but may not be the most efficient option in terms of memory, especially in larger mazes.
3.	DFS Algorithm:
•	DFS can be memory-efficient but may not always find the shortest path.
•	It is suitable for applications where memory constraints are critical, but optimality is not a strict requirement.
Limitations:
1.	Completeness:
•	None of the algorithms consistently guarantee completeness. They may fail to find a path in certain scenarios.
2.	Memory Usage:
•	BFS can use a significant amount of memory, especially in large mazes.
•	DFS may use less memory but can be inefficient in finding the shortest path.
Potential Applications:
1.	A*:
•	A* is suitable for various real-world scenarios, such as:
•	GPS navigation systems for finding optimal routes.
•	Robotics for path planning.
•	Game development for character movement.
2.	BFS Algorithm:
•	BFS is valuable when finding the shortest path is critical, even if it requires substantial memory usage. Applications include:
•	Network routing algorithms.
•	Shortest path problems in transportation networks.
3.	DFS Algorithm:
•	DFS is useful in scenarios where memory efficiency is essential and optimality is not a strict requirement. Applications include:
•	Solving puzzles with search spaces.
•	Web crawling to explore websites efficiently.
